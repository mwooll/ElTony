Group project for the course Interactive-Visual Data Analysis at UZH, for the Fall semester of 23.

In our project we will build an interactive visual recommender system that should help gamers decide what Pokémon they want to use to achieve their specified goal.

Group members: Lara Fried, Zejie Guo, Matija Zver, Mark Woolley

The Pokémon images were taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kvpratama/pokemon-images-dataset/
